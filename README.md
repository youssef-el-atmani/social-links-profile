### Links

- Live Site URL: [social-links-profile](https://youssef-el-atmani.github.io/social-links-profile/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned that the `address` element should only used to wrap the contact info, I said nothing new, but the problem was how I thought it is used, I thought whenever you see an _email, or location, or phone_, I thought it should be wrapped in `<address>` element, and what I learned is that that only valid if it is part of contact info, it doesn't matter if it is a single person contact, or website contact, or an organization contact.

### Continued development

- I will try to improve my understanding of the HTML elements, so that I can use the right HTML elements for the right things.
- I will continually improving my documentation abilities, precisely writing good commit messages.
